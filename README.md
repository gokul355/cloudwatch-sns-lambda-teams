# cloudwatch-sns-lambda-teams
This repository contains the architecture diagram and Lambda function implementation for a system that automatically sends notifications to Microsoft Teams whenever a CloudWatch alarm is triggered. The solution leverages AWS SNS to invoke the Lambda function, which then formats and sends the alarm details to a  Teams channel.
